## Actor Grapher
Application: http://actor-grapher-actor-grapher.193b.starter-ca-central-1.openshiftapps.com/

#### Actor Grapher is the Node.js web version of my previous Python tkinter application.

---

##### Actor Grapher is a visualization tool that displays Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each actor/director’s movies. Movie ratings are displayed over time using a scatter plot, sorted by movie number. 

##### The application will be deployed once I have resolved the error handling requirements. 

Changes in progress:
* Error handling functionalities, including error messages
* Removing tooltips from the line of best fit
* Scaling the graph to fit the screen height-wise
* A mode for users to view trends in a movie franchise’s ratings (e.g. Star Wars and Marvel)
* User can click on any movie and be taken to it's associated web page
